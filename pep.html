                    <h3>PEP</h3>
                    <p><b>CULTURE AND VALUES:</b><br/><br/>
                        PEP people are known as Dynamos and are famous for greeting each other with a high five. This is no accident – it stems from PEP’s unique Sikhula KunYe (growing together) culture, which unites everyone who works at the business – regardless of age, gender or job function – and makes PEP one of the most exciting companies to work for in southern Africa.
                    <p>The vibrant PEP company culture is famous throughout southern Africa and other African countries. The brand was recently rated – again – as one of the top inspiring business cultures in the world (Barrett Culture Survey, 2017).</p>



                    <p>PEP believes in giving back to the local communities it serves and its flagship CSI project is the PEP Academy. There are 25 PEP Academies operating within existing schools across four provinces, helping to build a stronger early learning foundation for more than 4 000 grade 4 and 5 learners. From 2008 to 2019, PEP Academy has assisted approximately 18 500 learners and hundreds of teachers and school managers.  </p>

                    <p>To further enhance PEP’s focus on education, it has partnered with Thandulwazi, a programme of the St Stithians Foundation. This initiative will extend its teacher development programme to the Limpopo province, offering approximately 200 teachers early childhood education support and training in the Modimolle area.</p>
